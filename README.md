# C-Lua CMake Template

# 1. Introduction
Based on this really great blog [post](https://lucasklassmann.com/blog/2019-02-02-how-to-embeddeding-lua-in-c/) I have grouped a small 
project template that shows simple introductory ways to integrate `lua` into a `C`
application.

# 2. Dependencies
1. `CMake`
2. `Lua` and its embedding/development headers

## 2.1 Debian Systems
```
TODO
```

## 2.2 Arch Systems
```
sudo pacman -S cmake lua
```

# 3. Getting Started
1. Run
```sh
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

2. Now from the output and the single c file, it will become very clear how the
8 examples there implemented are working.
